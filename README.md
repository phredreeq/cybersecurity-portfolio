# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on journey into cybersecurity with a strong focus on SOC analyst and defensive security skills. It contains practical labs, troubleshooting exercises, and real-world simulations covering networking, Linux internals, firewall configuration, and security monitoring.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical understanding and problem-solving ability, not just theoretical knowledge.

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates
- Hands-on security lab building and troubleshooting
- Strong fundamentals in networking and Linux
- Defender and SOC analyst mindset
- Ability to investigate issues using logs and system evidence
- Clear technical documentation with screenshots
- Progressive learning with increasing complexity

All labs are practical and documented with explanations and visual evidence.

## Lab Highlights

### Day 1 – Networking Basics
Focused on understanding how systems communicate within a network.  
Key areas covered include network segmentation, IP addressing, interface configuration, and basic connectivity testing.

---

### Day 4 – pfSense Firewall Rules
Focused on controlling and inspecting network traffic using firewall rules.  
Activities included blocking unauthorized SSH access, allowing legitimate HTTP traffic, and verifying rule behavior through testing and firewall logs.

---

### Day 5 – Network Troubleshooting
Focused on diagnosing and resolving common network issues.  
Scenarios included DNS failures, blocked services, and packet loss simulation. Emphasis was placed on systematic troubleshooting and log-based verification.

---

### Day 6 – Linux Internals for Security
Focused on Linux from a defender’s perspective.  
Covered user and permission management, process monitoring, and authentication log investigation to understand how system activity is controlled and recorded.

---

### Day 7 – Windows Security Basics
- Verified Windows Firewall status  
- Analyzed failed login events (Event ID 4625)  
- Identified service configuration changes (Event ID 7040)

---

## Day 8 – Centralized Logging (Splunk)
Deployed Splunk Enterprise on Ubuntu and configured Windows Universal Forwarder to send Windows Event Logs (Security, System, Application) to a centralized SIEM. Built a SOC-style monitoring dashboard to analyze authentication activity, including successful (4624) and failed (4625) logon events.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Linux systems (Ubuntu Server, Kali Linux)
- pfSense firewall
- Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, ICMP)
- Linux system monitoring and logging
- SSH and authentication mechanisms
- Windows 10 VM
- Virtualized lab environments

---

## Focus Areas
- SOC analyst fundamentals
- Blue Team and defensive security
- Incident investigation mindset
- Practical troubleshooting skills
- Clear and professional documentation

## About Me
I am building a strong foundation in cybersecurity with the goal of working in a Security Operations Center or other defensive security roles. This portfolio reflects my commitment to learning through hands-on practice and continuous improvement.

---

## Ongoing Development
This portfolio is actively maintained and will continue to grow with additional labs focused on log analysis, detection techniques, incident response workflows, and SIEM-based investigations.
